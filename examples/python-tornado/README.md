# python-tornado

This example contains a simple `perspective-python` folder that uses Tornado to
serve a static dataset to the user through various data bindings. There are a
examples of end-to-end `perspective-viewer` integrated `.html` files hosted:

-   `index.html`: a
    [client/server replicated](https://perspective.finos.org/docs/md/server.html#clientserver-replicated)
    setup that synchronizes the client and server data using Apache Arrow.
-   `server_mode.html`: a
    [server-only](https://perspective.finos.org/docs/md/server.html#server-only)
    setup that reads data and performs operations directly on the server using
    commands sent through the Websocket.
-   `client_server_editing.html`: a client-server replicated setup that also
    enables editing, where edits from multiple clients are applied properly to
    the server, and then synchronized back to the clients.
