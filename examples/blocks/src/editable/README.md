A simple example of [Perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective) with
superstore data, and editability enabled (not default but easy to toggle at
runtime).

An explcit `SharedWorker` is used to create the Perspective engine, allowing
edits to be shared live when this example is opened across multiple browser
tabs.
