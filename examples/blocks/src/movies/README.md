Demo of a [Perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective) visualizing a dataset of
3,201 films. Each row in the dataset is a film, with dimensional data such as production studio, rating and genre, as well as observations such as box-office gross.

This dataset is bootstrapped off the [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
[demo page](https://vega.github.io/editor/data/movies.json"), and has no server
component itself, showing how easy it is to use Perspective's client-side architecture
to get a fully-interactive BI experience, on top of already-deployed web data artifacts
without modification or intermediate servers.
