A ray-casting engine written as an [ExprTK](https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk)
Expression within [Perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective). As presented
at [Open Source in Finance 2022 NY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ut-ynvBpGI).

This example has no server component, and all ray-casting is done entirely
within the Perspective WebAssembly engine.
