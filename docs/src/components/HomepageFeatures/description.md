## What is Perspective?

Perspective is an <i>interactive</i> analytics and data visualization component,
which is especially well-suited for <i>large</i> and/or <i>streaming</i>
datasets. Use it to create user-configurable reports, dashboards, notebooks and
applications, then deploy stand-alone in the browser, or in concert with Python
and/or [Jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
